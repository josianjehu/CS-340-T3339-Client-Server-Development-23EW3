# AAC Dashboard MongoDB

## FAQ

#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When I program I focus on making many notations. These are useful so that I never lose track on the train of thought I had at the moment I was dealing with that section of code. For making code easily maintainable I focus on making reusable code so that I am not constantly writing the same code which makes the program longer and longer. Working this way makes code easier to read and understand which makes debugging and writing code much easier. In the future if I ever need to use MongoDB I would implement a CRUD module so that it simplifies the process of maintaining the database.

#### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist I always read over and understand the structure of the program that I am modifying and then I come up with various solutions to the problem that I need to solve to avoid getting tunnel vision. During this project I followed the same steps that I usually follow when I write code. I did not implement a new strategy to write the code that was needed for this project. If possible when dealing with databases I would like to come up with a CRUD module thats even more expanded from the one that I used to better deal and maintain the database.

#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A computer scientists program code, besides programing code they also analyze code to improve the code and make sure that the functionality that is intended for that program is met. Problem solving is a big part of what computer scientists do, this includes developing, debugging, testing and modifying. By making projects like this one the company is able to work in a streamline and simple way. Looking over many documents one by one and filtering through using your eyes and memory alone is difficult therefore a database with a dashboard simplifies this process like how it was done in Grazioso Salvare.
